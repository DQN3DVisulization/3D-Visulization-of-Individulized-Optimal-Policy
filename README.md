#### First download the html files to your local disk.

###### Click on the green button "Clone or download" and then click "Download the ZIP". Unzip the downloaded file as you normally would. Or please refer to the fowlloing instructions on how to unzip a file if you are Windows user (https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14200/windows-compress-uncompress-zip-files) or a Mac user (https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/compress-uncompress-files-folders-mac-mchlp2528/mac)
###### An alternative way is to click on the link, e.g."Day1.html", and then right-click the "download" button on the new webpage. Select "Save link as..." and download the html file to your local disk.

#### Then double-click on the html file of each day. It should open in your browser, e.g. Google Chrome.

#### Each dot in the 3D interacive space represents an individual customer. Hoovering on it appears the customer's starting state as the DQN model input on that day and individulized optimal treatment. Each visulization allows you to zoom in/out and rotate in any direction.
