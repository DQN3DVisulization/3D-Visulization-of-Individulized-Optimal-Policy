#### This is the daily 3D visualization of individualized optimal treatment conditional on the reading state input (Figure 7)

#### First download the html files to your local disk.

#### Then double-click on the html file of each day. It should open in your browser, e.g. Google Chrome.

#### Each dot in the 3D interacive space represents an indivual customer and hoovering on it will appear the customer's individulized optimal treatment and input state on that day. Each visulization allows you to zoom in/out and rotate in any direction.
